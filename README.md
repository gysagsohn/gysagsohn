Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gy Sohn
I'm a passionate full-stack developer transitioning from a career in law and construction to the tech industry. After completing a Diploma of Information Technology from Coder Academy, Iâ€™ve gained experience with the MERN stack, JavaScript, Python, and more.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on honing my skills through real-world projects and coding challenges, and Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate, learn, and grow. I'm open to new opportunities where I can contribute, improve my expertise, and help build innovative solutions.

Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch.
